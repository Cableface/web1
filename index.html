  <p>Garchomp is described as the "Mach Pok√©mon" that can soar at blinding speed, with protuberances on its head that act as sensors and a disposition described as vicious or feral, requiring utmost caution when encountered in the wild. It is a formidable Dragon- and Ground-type that hunts relentlessly, using the scythe-like blades on its arms to carve opponents.</p>
